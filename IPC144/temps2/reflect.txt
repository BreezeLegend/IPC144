The reason why we use arrays is to make a collection of numbers be easier to access the
alternative way you could of wrote this program is using SIZE.
An advantage of using parralel arrays is that your code looks more organized and it needs
less space to write the code. 
The reason why loops use zero as an iteration is because they are looping thorough an
array and because an array always starts at zero.
