The first reason why an array of structs is better than a parallel arrays is that parallel arrays are harder to organize
because every time you add an additional field you will have to add another array, as if you want to pass the entity as a whole to another 
function you will have to pull out all the items. Another advantage of array of structs is that of its runtime because having all common data
together will be much more efficient use of the CPU's memory, and DRAM memory. In the end arrays of struct runs faster in most use cases 
compared to parallel arrays.
